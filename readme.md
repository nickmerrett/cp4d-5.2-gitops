# CP4D Non-OLM GitOps Installation

This project implements automated GitOps installation and management for IBM Cloud Pak for Data and related cartridges, using the Non-OLM method. It leverages ArgoCD and Kustomize for resource layering and declarative configuration, supporting extension and secondary development.

## Solution Overview

This project aims to automated the Non-OLM installation method for CP4D and Cartrigdes and integrated with ArgoCD for continuous integration and delivery. It is developed based on [IBMSoftwareHub/charts/tree/5.2.0](https://github.ibm.com/IBMSoftwareHub/charts/tree/5.2.0), and utilizes Kustomize for resource layering and parameterization.

#### Key Features:
- Layered resource grouping (bootstrap, foundation, cluster, namespace, cartridge) for clean management
- Pluggable enable/disable for any cartridge
- Parameterisation and automatic variable substitution, making it easy to adapt to different environments and team collaboration
- Supports custom extension and secondary development

#### Newly Added Dependencies
- cert-manager-operator(for Red Hat OpenShift)
- ibm-ccs
- ibm-opensearch-operator
- ibm-rabbitmq-operator
- ibm-db2uoperator
- ibm-db2aaservice

#### Newly Added Cartridges

- OpenPages
- Cognos Analytics

## Usage

1. Click [Use this template](https://github.com/new?template_name=non-olm-cp4d-gitops&template_owner=gitops-cp4d) at the right top of this page to create your own repository, then clone it to your local and enter the project directory.

2. Edit the root `values.yaml` to customize namespaces, storage classes, and other parameters.  
Please make sure to update the value of `argoSourceRepoURL` to point to **your own created repository**. ArgoCD will treat this repository as the source of truth for synchronisation.  
If you are using a [Techzone environment](https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/tech-zone-certified-base-images/journey-base-open-shift), other parameters can be left as default.

3. Edit the root `kustomization.yaml` as needed. You can enable or disable any cartridge module by commenting or uncommenting its resource. It is recommended to disable all cartridges at first. Only enable (uncomment) the 3-cartridge resources in `kustomization.yaml` after Software Hub installation is completed and both `1-cluster-scope/` and `2-namespace-scope/` resources have been successfully reconciled.


4. Run the bootstrap script (only required for the first time setup):
    ```
    ./0-bootstrap/bootstrap.sh
    ```
    This script will:
    - Check the OpenShift environment and prerequisites
    - Update the Git repository address for Argo application manifest
    - Process and substitute all parameters in manifests
    - Push the updated manifests to the remote repository
    - Apply bootstrap manifests (such as namespaces, RBAC for Argo, health-checks)
    - Create the Kubernetes secret for your IBM Container Entitlement Key
    - Apply the top-level ArgoCD Application (`cp4d-gitops.yaml`)
    - Output ArgoCD dashboard login information

5. Any further changes (including enabling/disabling cartridges by commenting/uncommenting their resources in `kustomization.yaml` after Software Hub installation is completed) should be committed and pushed to your Git repository directly. ArgoCD will automatically detect and synchronize all changes from Git.


## Development Guide

- You are welcome to contribute more dependencies or cartridges. Please follow the existing layered directory structure for expansion.
- New dependencies should be placed in `3-cartridge/<cartridge-name>/` with a dedicated `kustomization.yaml` for modular aggregation.
- It is recommended to manage all parameters centrally in `values.yaml`.
- For development and extension, please refer to the technical specification: [Technical Specification: Non-OLM Install Method](https://github.ibm.com/PrivateCloud-analytics/CPD-TechSpec/blob/master/non-OLM-install-method.md)

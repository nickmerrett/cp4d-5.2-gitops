                      The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent
                      a termination signal and the time when the processes are forcibly halted with a kill signal.
                      Set this value longer than the expected cleanup time for your process.
                      If this value is nil, the pod's terminationGracePeriodSeconds will be used. Otherwise, this
                      value overrides the value provided by the pod spec.
                      Value must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates stop immediately via
                      the kill signal (no opportunity to shut down).
                      This is a beta field and requires enabling ProbeTerminationGracePeriod feature gate.
                      Minimum value is 1. spec.terminationGracePeriodSeconds is used if unset.

                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                        to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                        for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.

                        MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                        between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                        The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                        or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                        In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                        - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                        scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                        violate MaxSkew(1).
                        - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                        When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                        to topologies that satisfy it.
                        It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                      description: |-
                        MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                        When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                        Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                        And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                        this value has no effect on scheduling.
                        As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                        scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                        If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                        Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                        When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                        For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                        labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                        | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                        |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                        The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                        In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                        because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                        it will violate MaxSkew.

                        We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number
                        of pods into each bucket.
                        We define a domain as a particular instance of a topology.
                        Also, we define an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements of
                        nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                        e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                        And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a domain of that topology.

                        A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod
                        if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate
                        "MaxSkew" on some topology.
